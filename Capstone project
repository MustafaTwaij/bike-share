## Project Overview

**Cyclistic** is a bike share program with 5,824 bicycles and 692 docking stations spread across Chicago. What sets the company apart is its provision of assistive options, which are used by 8% of riders. 

The goal of this analysis is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

## Pricing Overview

Below is a breakdown of the pricing structure for various bike and scooter ride options offered by Cyclistic:

| **Ride Type**    | **Single Ride**                 | **Day Pass**                      | **Membership**                |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **General**      | $1 unlock + $0.18/min            | $18.10/day                        | $143.90/year                  |
| **Classic Bike** | $1 unlock + $0.18/min            | 3 hours free, then $0.18/min      | 45 min free, then $0.18/min   |
| **Ebike**        | $1 unlock + $0.44/min            | Free unlocks + $0.44/min          | Free unlocks + $0.18/min     |

## Data Source

The dataset for this analysis is based on Cyclisticâ€™s historical trip data collected over the last 12 months. Although Cyclistic is a fictional company, the dataset is modeled after the publicly available DIVVY.LYFT dataset for bike share programs in Chicago.

---

## Tools Used

- **Excel**: Data cleaning and preliminary analysis.
- **R Language**: Data visualization and advanced analysis.
- **Python**: Additional statistical modeling (if necessary).

---

## Methodology

The analysis follows these key steps:
1. **Prepare**: Collect and organize the dataset.
2. **Clean**: Remove inconsistencies and handle missing data.
3. **Analyze**: Look for trends in ride durations, frequencies, and usage patterns.
4. **Visualize**: Create compelling visualizations to highlight key findings.
5. **Share**: Present the findings and provide actionable insights.

## Key Findings

1. **Seasonal Trends**: 
   - Due to Chicago's cold climate, bike ride numbers increase significantly during the warmer months (spring and summer). 

2. **User Behavior**:
   - **Members**: Tend to use bikes primarily for work commutes.
   - **Casual Riders**: Are more likely to use bikes for leisure rides, often in tourist-heavy areas.
   
3. **Conversion Opportunity**: 
   - One of the most effective ways to convert casual riders into members is to offer the benefit of using the extended bike network in other cities. 
   - This can be a compelling incentive for casual riders to purchase an annual membership, as it enhances the value of the membership beyond just Chicago.

## Recommendations

To drive membership conversion, consider these strategies:
- **Extend the Network**: Partner with other cities or transportation systems to offer reciprocal membership benefits. This could attract casual riders who travel frequently and would value access to bikes in other cities.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Develop campaigns highlighting the benefits of year-round bike access and emphasize the convenience of membership for both daily commutes and recreational rides.
- **Increase Appeal to Commuters**: Since members tend to use the service primarily for work commutes, increasing the appeal to bikers who use bikes for commuting could help attract more members. Some strategies include:
    - **Corporate Partnerships**: Offer discounts or exclusive membership deals to companies that encourage their employees to commute by bike.
    - **Bike to Work Incentives**: Provide additional benefits for members who use bikes during peak work hours, like early-bird discounts or bonus minutes for morning commutes.

- **Expand Stations in Business Districts**: 
    - **Workplace Accessibility**: Casual riders tend to use bikes for leisure rides around tourist areas, while members require more access in work zones. 
    - By adding more stations in business districts or near office buildings, it could make it easier for members to use the service for their daily commutes.
    - This would provide greater convenience for members who prefer not to rely on bikes located primarily in tourist-heavy locations.

## Further Questions for Future Exploration

- What other benefits could be included in a membership package to make it more appealing to casual riders?
- How does weather affect the usage of different bike categories (classic bikes vs. ebikes)?
- What other external factors (e.g., pricing changes, seasonal events) might influence ridership trends?

## Conclusion

This analysis of Cyclistic's bike share program reveals significant opportunities to enhance the customer experience and drive membership conversions. By focusing on seasonal trends, user behavior, and offering new benefits like extended network access, Cyclistic can build stronger customer loyalty and increase long-term membership.

A full report with visualizations will be available shortly.
