# Cyclistic Bike Share Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of Cyclistic, a bike share program based in Chicago. The goal of this analysis is to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. The project utilizes data visualizations, statistical analysis, and key findings from 12 months of historical bike share trip data. 

## Project Details
- **Objective**: To analyze bike ride patterns, pricing strategies, and user behavior to help convert casual riders into annual members.
- **Tools Used**: Excel, R Language, Python
- **Data Source**: Cyclistic's fictional bike share trip data, modeled after the publicly available DIVVY.LYFT dataset.
  
## Key Findings:
- **Seasonality**: Bike ride numbers peak in spring and summer due to Chicago's climate.
- **Usage Patterns**: 
   - Members typically use bikes for daily commutes.
   - Casual riders tend to use bikes for leisure rides, often around tourist areas.
- **Conversion Strategies**: Offering network access in other cities and expanding work area stations could help convert casual riders into members.

## Recommendations:
- Extend the network to other cities or transport systems.
- Increase marketing targeted at work commuters.
- Expand stations in business districts to support work-focused use.

## Data Visualization:
- A **Total Number of Rides** visualization is embedded using DataWrapper to provide a clear picture of ride volume over time. This interactive chart can help identify seasonal trends and busy periods throughout the year.
